title: "Sunless Fae"

The Fae of the [[Surfless Sea]] are generally either ghostly white, pitch-dark, or a camouflage pattern of greys in-between - as there is, by default, no light in the depths of the Sea.

They also habitually make themselves into chimeras by achieving perfect synchronicity with creatures and merging with them. They can do this quite a few times.
