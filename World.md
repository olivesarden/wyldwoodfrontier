Frontier between the Empire and the Black Forest
Harvesting great old trees; and magical fruits/mushrooms?

Religious element?


Where the fields meet the Forest. Where the caverns meet the sky. Where the river runs dry. The Frontier is the edge between worlds, and it'll cut you to the quick.

tl;dr: this campaign is a fantasy sandbox SWADE game with a heavy focus on political intrigue. Magitech, eldritch fae, nobility, and unconventional fantasy creatures will all have a heavy presence.

The Wyrdwood Frontier is a loose union of city-states established as a compromise between the [Dawnmark Imperium](Organizations/Factions/Dawnmark%20Imperium.md) and the [Sunless Fae](Organizations/Factions/Sunless%20Fae.md) of the [Surfless Sea](Locations/Surfless%20Sea.md). The Imperials would not limit or tax trade from upriver into the pitch-dark forest of the Surfless Sea, and the Sunless Fae would not prevent the harvesting of brightbulbs from within the Sea, nor the felling of the Great Trees at the edge of the Sea.

In practise, this makes the Frontier a region of perilous balance - the grand industries and magitech of the Dawnmark to the west, the terrifying eldritch forest of the Surfless Sea to the east, the unyielding forgehalls of the undying dwarven clans in the mountains above and the maze-like warrens of the caverns below. It is a place of great opportunity, and the site of many tragic failures.

The players of this campaign make up the [Advisory Council](Organizations/Factions/Advisory%20Council.md) to the Mayor of [Riversend](Locations/Riversend.md), the largest settlement in the Wyrdwood Frontier and its only real city. While you each will have your own agendas to pursue, your fortunes are all bound to the future of Riversend and the Frontier as a whole - this responsibility will always come first.

The focus of this game is intended to be on political intrigue - you're relatively small players in a big game, and the wellbeing of many people will rely on your actions. Combat and adventuring will play a role, but in many circumstances this may run counter to your goals. Player-vs-player conflict is intended to play a small role at most - if your character's goals pivot to run directly counter to the rest of the table, it will be treated (with discussion) the same as if a D&D character turned evil against the other PCs.

The other specifics depend highly on the table - I run sandbox campaigns, with the expectation that wherever the party's focus wanders is where I will create content to engage with. Generally speaking, a plot will emerge out of this, but what that looks like depends very heavily on what you all care about! We'll be running this in the current version of SWADE, using the Fantasy Companion. I'm open to other setting books and SWADE supplements, but not super familiar with them.



Hey Liam! I believe Alex vaguely mentioned this to you at some point, but I wanted to swing through and make my own full pitch.

In short, I know that the 40k game you folks were trying to get started in your Friday slot fell apart, mostly because Alex is firmly anti-40k. From my (exceptionally selfish) perspective, this looked *very* much like an opportunity to try and get both you and Kyle at a table, two people that I've been waiting for a good chance to get to know better.

So basically I'm trying to elbow my way into the Friday night timeslot, and steal this table.

I really want to run a character-driven, political-intrigue focused sandbox campaign in SWADE using the Fantasy Companion rules.

Considering how incredibly you play Malistuir at BR, and the immaculate vibe you bring with you, I honestly couldn't think of a *better* player for the concept.

Right now, the full list of players for the table I'm hoping to have is: yourself, Kyle, Chris, Alex, Mae, and Linnea. Six players *is* on the bigger side, and it's my personal cap (I've run for as many as nine, and that was an experience not to be repeated).

I'm going to drop the full pitch in here for you to read at your leisure - please let me know if you're interested, or if you have any questions/comments/critiques at all!



Heya Kyle!

I heard that the 40k game that was supposed to be running in the Friday night timeslot for you, Chris, Alex and Liam ended up falling apart by virtue of Alex's firm anti-40k stance. From my (exceptionally selfish) perspective, this looked *very* much like an opportunity to try and get both you and Liam at a table, two people that I've been waiting for a good chance to get to know better.

So basically I'm trying to elbow my way into the Friday night timeslot, and steal this table.

To my understanding, you're pretty keen on political intrigue in TTRPGs, and I've *very much* enjoyed every opportunity I've had to roleplay with you so far.

Right now, the full list of players for the table I'm hoping to have is: yourself, Liam, Chris, Alex, Mae, and Linnea. Six players *is* on the bigger side, and it's my personal cap (I've run for as many as nine, and that was an experience not to be repeated). The VGs have said they're happy to host if that ends up being easier for everyone, otherwise you've seen how well set up my place is for games!

Also worth noting: my personal philosophy with running TTRPGs is that I run games as long as I have 3 of my regular players. I know life gets unbearably busy for you at times, so I wanted to make it super clear that joining this game *would not* require you to be able to commit every single Friday night to being there.
