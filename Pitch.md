*Where the fields meet the Forest. Where the caverns meet the sky. Where the river runs dry. The Frontier is the edge between worlds, and it'll cut you to the quick.*

tl;dr: this campaign is a fantasy sandbox SWADE game with a heavy focus on political intrigue. Magitech, eldritch fae, nobility, and unconventional fantasy creatures will all have a heavy presence.

The Wyrdwood Frontier is a loose union of city-states established as a compromise between the [[Dawnmark Imperium]] and the [[Sunless Fae]] of the [[Surfless Sea]]. The Imperials would not limit or tax trade from upriver into the pitch-dark forest of the Surfless Sea, and the Sunless Fae would not prevent the harvesting of brightbulbs from within the Sea, nor the felling of the Great Trees at the edge of the Sea.

In practise, this makes the Frontier a region of perilous balance - the grand industries and magitech of the Dawnmark to the west, the terrifying eldritch forest of the Surfless Sea to the east, the unyielding forgehalls of the undying dwarven clans in the mountains above and the maze-like warrens of the caverns below. It is a place of great opportunity, and the site of many tragic failures.

The players of this campaign make up the [[Advisory Council]] to the Mayor of [[Riversend]], the largest settlement in the Wyrdwood Frontier and its only real city. While you each will have your own agendas to pursue, your fortunes are all bound to the future of Riversend and the Frontier as a whole - this responsibility will always come first.

The focus of this game is intended to be on political intrigue - you're relatively small players in a big game, and the wellbeing of many people will rely on your actions. Combat and adventuring will play a role, but in many circumstances this may run counter to your goals. Player-vs-player conflict is intended to play a small role at most - if your character's goals pivot to run directly counter to the rest of the table, it will be treated (with discussion) the same as if a D&D character turned evil against the other PCs.

The other specifics depend highly on the table - I run sandbox campaigns, with the expectation that wherever the party's focus wanders is where I will create content to engage with. Generally speaking, a plot will emerge out of this, but what that looks like depends very heavily on what you all care about! We'll be running this in the current version of SWADE, using the Fantasy Companion. I'm open to other setting books and SWADE supplements, but not super familiar with them.
